# 3D-Render
3D Render Engine A Python-based 3D rendering engine using OpenGL. It supports object creation (cube, sphere), manipulation (move, scale, rotate), and scene interaction via ray picking. Objects can be moved, scaled, and rotated with mouse/keyboard controls. Easily extendable with new 3D shapes and interactions.
